Realized thermal niche approach eliminates temperature bias in bioenergetic model estimates

Diet change in proportions per size of predator (weight was extrapolated from length-weight relationship) from age 1 through 15 for lake trout and 0 to 4 for Chinook salmon. Lake trout diet proportions were obtained from Rand and Stewart (1998), Madenjian, Desorcie, and Stedman (1998) and Chinook salmon from Mumby et al. (2018).
